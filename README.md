# Welcome to the Golang Algorithm Club

This project is an effort to write some of the most commonly used algorithms and data structures in golang. This is just the start and we have a long way to go. 

The idea of this project was conceived from the work done by the Swift community in [building](https://github.com/raywenderlich/swift-algorithm-club) the Swift Algorithm Club. 

If you're a computer science student who needs to learn this stuff for exams -- or if you're a self-taught programmer who wants to brush up on the theory behind your craft -- you've come to the right place!

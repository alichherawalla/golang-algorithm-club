# Welcome to the Golang Algorithm Club

![Golang Algorithm Club](https://github.com/wednesday-solutions/golang-algorithm-club/workflows/Golang%20Algorithm%20Club/badge.svg)

This project is an effort to write some of the most commonly used algorithms and data structures in golang. This is just the start and we have a long way to go. 

The idea of this project was conceived from the work done by the Swift community in [building](https://github.com/raywenderlich/swift-algorithm-club) the Swift Algorithm Club. 

If you're a computer science student who needs to learn this stuff for exams -- or if you're a self-taught programmer who wants to brush up on the theory behind your craft -- you've come to the right place!
